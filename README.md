ji# 100 day coding challenge
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.<br> <br>
<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array</strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type</strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.</strong><br><br>

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Arrays-DS </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the hourglass sum.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dynamic arrays </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed.
Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left rotation </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:A Left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 6: String Similarity </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Calculate the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's suffixes.
