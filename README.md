# 100 day coding challenge
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.<br> <br>
<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array</strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type</strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.</strong><br><br>

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Arrays-DS </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the hourglass sum.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dynamic arrays </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed.
Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left rotation </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:A Left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 6: String Similarity </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Calculate the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's suffixes.


<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 7: Digit Frequency </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Print ten space-separated integers in a single line denoting the frequency of each digit from 0 to 9 .


<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 8: Calculate the Nth term </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:There is a series,S , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a,b, and  respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.


<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 9: Power Calculation </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Print the last two digits of S for each test case in separate lines

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 10: Permuting Two Arrays </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:There will be  queries consisting of A,B,and K . For each query, return YES if some permutation A',B'  satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 11: Array Reversal</strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: reversing the given array

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 12:Student marks</strong><br><br> Statement: The array name,marks , works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words,marks contains the address where marks is stored in the memory.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 13:Bitwise operators </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1 , for each bit compared.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 14:Array Manupilation </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement: Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

<strong>ðŸ“Œ Day 16:Time Conversion </strong><br><br>
Problem Statement:Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
